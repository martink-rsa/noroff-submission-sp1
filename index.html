          <h2>
            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
            subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed
            for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
            when everyone’s gone home).

                Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
                on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.

                You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or
                why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly
                Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
                interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and
                explore.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
                Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
                experiment with our team of experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where
                you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
                discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find
                out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
                message.

              <p>
                As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
                create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
                give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
                learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
                will excite and inspire them.
              </p>

                Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
                facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
                for a visit.
