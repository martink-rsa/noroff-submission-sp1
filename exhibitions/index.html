              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
              Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
              the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            </p>

              Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
              traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the
              planets in our solar system.

              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world.

              For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
              quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
              understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
              the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
              the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our
              fellow creatures have beat us to it.

              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
              intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
              applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
              currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
              and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
              contribute to a brighter future.
